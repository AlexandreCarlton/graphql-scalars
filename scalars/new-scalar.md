# Guide to contribute a new Custom Scalar specification

In order to contribute a new Custom Scalar specification, please open a new PR
for each new Custom Scalar.

Use the "template-string.md" template for Custom Scalars based on the built-in
String Scalar.

Use the "template.md" template for all other Custom Scalars.

Modify your selected template, and save it in the correct place
"scalars/contributed/<github-user-name>/<scalar-name>.md". The directory
location is important, as this will form part of the reference URL for your
specification.
